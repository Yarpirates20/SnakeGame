# SnakeGame :snake:
 
Snake game in C++ for console.

Really fun project from [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners #5: Snake](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/02/programming-project-5-snake/)

The tutorial is written in pseudocode so I was able to learn a lot by solving my own problems and making my own decisions.
Plus the writing is pretty funny.

Learned through grueling labor how to structure an OOP program, more about the pros and cons of different containers in C++ then I really planned to, and what *is* a snake!
